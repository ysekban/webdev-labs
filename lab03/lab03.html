                The implementation in Part A, done using pure HTML and CSS, provided a good exercise in understanding the fundamentals of responsive design. Creating a fluid grid system and utilizing media queries to handle different screen sizes were the major tasks. However, this approach required a more manual setup which was both time-consuming and required a precise understanding of CSS and responsive design principles.

                On the other hand, the implementation in Part B using Bootstrap significantly simplified the process. Bootstrap's predefined grid system and utility classes made it much quicker and easier to achieve a responsive design. This approach was less time-consuming and the result was equally effective. Personally, the Bootstrap approach was more convenient due to its ease of use and the speed of development.
